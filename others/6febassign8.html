                       <mark style="background-color:orange;">Although I disagree with much that those who oppose animal
                        testing say, I fully endrose their final conclusion that there
                         are many better alternatives to animal testing.
                       The Food and Drug Administration has stated that they support 
                       the development and use of alternatives to animal testing.</mark>
                        <mark style="background-color:greenyellow;"> Moreover,"Scientists have developed methods to test cosmetics
                         and other personal products that are faster, cheaper and more
                          accurate than traditional animal testing."(Title of Text)

                        <mark style="background-color:rgb(0, 119, 255);">In other words there are better alternatives to 
                        animal testing and the FDA agrees
                        </mark>
                        <mark style="background-color:skyblue;">Some Readers may challenge the view that animal
                         testing can be done away with .After all, many believe that
                         it is impossible to eliminate the need for animals in research. Nonetheless my discusion of alternatives
                          to animal testing in fact addressing the larger issue of choice.</mark>
                        <mark style="background-color:rgb(0, 119, 255);">If we don't
                        need to use animals,why should we?
