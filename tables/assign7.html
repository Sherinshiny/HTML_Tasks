       <p>The 200 foot cedar and hemlock trees extend,trying to reach the sky.We stop the car.Get out.
        Every thing is covered in moss.Giant green ferns and mushrooms are everywhere.It smells of fresh rain and soil.
        Nearby I hear the soft trickling of a creek.The forest and fog compliment each other.The remaining fog
    swirls in spirals within the rays of sunlight. </p>
